            <p><strong>Precautionary Measures:</strong> I started exercising regularly (30 minutes of walking daily),
                reduced salt intake, and practiced relaxation techniques like deep breathing and meditation.</p>

                changes.</p>
            <p><strong>Diet:</strong> I followed a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, which includes
                plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products.</p>

            <p><strong>Symptoms :</strong>I had frequent wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and tightness in my
                chest, especially after physical activity or exposure to cold air. </p>
            <p><strong>Precautionary Measures:</strong> I started using an air purifier at home, avoided allergens like
                dust, and practiced breathing exercises to improve lung capacity.</p>
            <p><strong>Doctor Consulted:</strong>I consulted a pulmonologist who conducted spirometry tests and adjusted
                my treatment plan.</p>
            <p><strong>Diet:</strong> I maintained a healthy diet that included anti-inflammatory foods like
                omega-3-rich fish, green vegetables, and fresh fruits while avoiding dairy and processed foods that can
                exacerbate asthma symptoms.</p>
            <p><strong>Medication:</strong>- The doctor prescribed a combination of an inhaler (salbutamol for immediate
                relief) and a corticosteroid (fluticasone) for long-term control. I also take montelukast (10 mg) daily.
